        ABOUT ME
      </h2>
      <p className="mt-4">
        I'm not just a code-slinging developer, I'm a pixel alchemist,
        transforming designs into living, breathing online experiences. With
        Over Two years of conjuring front-end magic, I bring websites and web
        apps to life with a potent blend of technical prowess and artistic
        flair.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        My canvas? HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the tools I wield to sculpt
        interactive interfaces that are as visually captivating as they are
        intuitively navigable. I obsess over pixel-perfect layouts, meticulously
        crafting user journeys that are smooth and seamless across devices. But
        my artistry goes beyond the surface. I breathe life into static designs
        with dynamic elements, weaving interactivity that engages users and
        tells stories.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        So, whether you're brewing a brand-new website or casting a spell on an
        existing one, I'm the alchemist you need to transform your vision into
        reality. Let's craft something extraordinary together.
